#Integra

#### About

This repository contains a sample Python script demonstrating how to connect to the Satel Integra via the ETHM-1 module and perform basic operations.

This has been written in few hours, so do not expect high quality code there (especially as Python is not the language of my first choice, although I would love to know it better).

It theoretically requires Python 3, but I am sure you smart cookie can easily modify it to work with 2.6/2.7.

I am using a very similar code myself  to send notification using <http://prowlapp.com/> to my phone whenever house is armed or disarmed.

Enjoy!
